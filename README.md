# ArtificalIntelligenceProjects

My projects from the CS188 Artificial Intelligence Class

## Project 1:

I implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

## Project 2:

Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. I implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## Project 3:

I implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbookâ€™s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

## Project 4:

Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. I implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

## Project 5:

I implemented the perceptron algorithm and neural network models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification.
